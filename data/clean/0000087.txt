classic
hit
my
daughter
came
home
her
first
weeks
of
high
school
with
an
enthusiasm
and
sparkle
towards
literature
that
i
had
not
seen
in
years
from
her
the
characters
are
wonderful
.
wholesome
classic
themes
.
rich
vocabulary
and
literary
devices
.
engaging
and
heartwarming
.
i
am
so
pleased
to
see
her
reinspired
and
empassioned
in
finding
a
series
that
speaks
to
her
heart
.
the
value
offered
in
this
series
from
a
price-point
standpoint
is
also
exceptional
and
the
handsome
casing
provides
attractive
storage
.
this
is
a
must-have
to
feed
your
child
's
developing
spirit
without
littering
their
experiences
with
over-sexed
images
and
discussions
.
there
is
enough
time
for
them
to
engage
in
that
dialogue
in
the
years
to
come
--
-this
allows
young
teens
to
be
young
teens

loved
it
i
really
could
read
this
series
again
and
again
.
i
love
anne
and
watching
her
grow
up
as
i
did
too
.
i
'll
never
forget
the
awesome
trips
i
took
with
this
book
in
hand
.
i
recomenend
everyone
with
an
imagination
to
read
this
series
.
i
loved
everything
about
it
especially
that
i
'm
so
much
like
anne
minus
the
red
hair
.
i
read
this
book
for
the
first
time
during
the
fifth
grade
and
i
cant
stop
picking
it
up
.
i
never
finished
the
series
thought
because
my
local
libary
has
until
the
5th
book
.
i
would
soo
like
to
finish
but
i
really
cant
spare
the
money
right
now
to
buy
the
series
.
for
those
who
can
i
really
urge
you
to
find
that
creative
and
imaginative
side
in
all
of
you
that
montgomery
is
sure
to
bring
out
.

a
great
heroine
of
literature
anne
of
green
gables
is
one
of
the
best
characters
of
literature
and
i
first
read
this
at
a
very
young
age
.
i
bought
this
set
thru
barnes
and
noble
and
re-read
all
that
writing
that
so
fascinated
me
as
a
child
.
as
i
read
i
share
it
with
my
10
year-old
daughter
and
she
is
greatly
enthrawled
by
this
as
well
.
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
everyone
who
has
n't
read
this
is
that
much
poorer
for
it
since
this
is
such
a
great
story

highly
rated
this
was
a
wonderful
book
and
i
could
see
why
mark
twain
called
anne
of
green
gables
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
literature
written
.
it
became
the
first
in
the
series
of
five
novels
.
i
could
not
help
feeling
sad
reading
the
first
couple
of
chapters
and
seeing
how
anne
was
called
an
ugly
red
head
and
unfortunate
.
soon
i
was
able
to
see
some
of
myself
in
anne
and
i
wanted
good
things
for
her
.
her
seeking
kindred
spirits
for
life
long
alliances
is
how
i
think
of
my
friends
as
well
.
slowly
throughout
the
book
i
liked
how
montgomery
made
the
attitudes
the
characters
had
in
the
beginning
change
and
loosen
as
the
story
was
told
.
marilla
evolves
from
anne
's
stern
guardian
into
a
gentle
complementing
mother-like
figure
.
this
is
a
book
i
recommend
to
middle
school
readers
and
older
who
really
like
to
read
and
who
want
to
feel
what
it
is
like
to
be
different
.

if
only
there
were
more
books
like
these
my
personal
l.
m.
montgomery
library
is
a
hodge-podge
of
various
used
and
new
books
.
the
first
one
i
read
was
of
course
anne
of
green
gables
.
at
the
timei
was
in
5th
grade
and
had
just
finished
reading
the
lotr
series
.
i
purchased
'green
gables
'
at
my
school
book
fair
and
an
hour
or
so
later
i
was
sent
home
sick
with
the
flu
.
as
soon
as
i
was
well
again
i
began
avidly
searching
for
any
other
'anne
'
books
i
could
find
.
that
kept
me
occupied
for
about
another
year
i
loved
those
books
soooo
much
i
cried
when
i
finished
reading
rilla
of
ingleside
.
luckliy
for
me
there
was
also
the
emily
trilogy
and
the
pat
books
and
the
blue
castle
to
keep
me
occupied
all
through
middle
school
.
whether
its
for
you
or
someone
you
love
if
you
are
looking
for
sweet
vivid
and
engrossing
stories
these
are
the
answer
to
your
prayers
.
