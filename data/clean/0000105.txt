the
eagle
has
landedâ
analysis
the
eagle
has
landed
â
is
a
daring
novel
and
pulls
off
a
difficult
trick
.
that
it
succeeds
triumphantly
is
a
testament
to
a
great
thriller
writer
.
this
success
starts
from
a
great
high
concept
â
and
then
builds
on
it.â
the
novel
is
relatively
slow
placed
until
the
fallschirmjãger
land
in
england
but
the
tension
develops
steadily
.
once
in
england
the
pace
accelerates
for
an
action-packed
last
quarter
.
the
final
twist
is
stunning
on
a
first
read
.
the
issues
there
are
two
main
problems
that
jack
higgins
overcame
the
first
problem
is
that
as
with
the
day
of
the
jackal
we
know
the
ending
before
we
start
.
winston
churchill
was
not
kidnapped
by
the
germans
during
world
war
two
.
so
steiner
must
fail
its
just
a
question
of
how
.
second
the
reader
is
being
asked
to
accept
a
nazi
soldier
and
an
ira
terrorist
as
sympathetic
protagonists
.
in
the
day
of
the
jackal
frederick
forsyth
solved
the
problem
by
making
the
story
into
a
howdunit.â
the
vital
key
that
jack
higgins
used
to
solve
these
issues
was
to
make
the
varied
cast
of
characters
vivid
and
sympathetic
.
making
difficult
characters
sympathetic
higgins
gets
around
the
problem
of
making
the
protagonists
sympathetic
in
two
clever
ways
.
first
higgins
has
an
eye
for
character
in
a
way
that
alistair
maclean
for
example
never
had
.
he
uses
that
skill
to
make
steiner
and
devlin
as
sympathetic
as
possible
to
the
reader
.
in
fact
to
a
modern
eye
he
potentially
even
goes
too
far
as
anti-heroes
are
much
more
mainstream
than
they
used
to
be
.
steiner
and
his
men
are
professional
soldiers
not
nazis
.
they
are
in
a
penal
unit
after
attempting
to
stop
an
ss
unit
killing
a
jewish
girl
.
steiner
himself
has
an
old-fashioned
code
of
honour
and
his
father
is
an
anti-nazi
who
is
imprisoned
by
the
gestapo.â
he
also
has
no
negative
personal
characteristics
at
all
.
his
men
love
him
.
women
love
him
.
hes
thoughtful
charming
and
strong
.
he
inspires
instant
respect
in
everyone
he
meets
.
devlin
is
a
more
complex
character
than
steiner
possibly
because
he
is
based
on
a
real
personâ
frank
ryan
an
ira
man
who
fought
on
the
republican
side
in
spain
was
captured
and
spent
the
war
in
germany
.
devlin
is
a
ruthless
ira
terrorist
but
hes
also
charming
funny
and
full
of
self-doubt
.
he
falls
for
a
local
girl
and
defends
her
against
a
local
thug
and
would-be
rapist
.
and
he
outwits
the
unpleasant
double-crossing
black-marketeers
.
this
is
a
classic
device
to
make
an
anti-hero
sympathetic
hes
not
as
bad
as
the
characters
hes
pitted
against
.
tragedy
as
story
theorists
from
aristotle
onwards
have
said
the
goal
of
tragedy
is
catharsis
the
creation
of
strong
emotion
in
the
reader
.
the
eagle
has
landed
â
has
a
mission
plot
.
the
preparations
are
shown
in
detail
as
radl
brings
the
team
together
and
all
the
characters
on
the
team
are
likeable
.
this
builds
the
readers
empathy
and
involvement
in
the
plot
but
they
know
it
must
fail
.
this
creates
the
classic
dichotomy
of
tragedy
.
because
of
their
sympathy
the
reader
wants
steiner
to
somehow
carry
the
plot
out
or
at
least
survive
but
feels
the
inevitable
approaching
creating
an
emotional
response
.
the
second
element
of
tragedy
is
that
the
characters
own
flaws
bring
about
their
demise
.
steiner
and
his
men
fail
because
they
are
too
nice
.
if
they
hadnt
saved
the
local
girl
they
would
not
have
been
exposed
and
the
mission
might
have
been
a
success
.
if
they
didnt
let
the
locals
go
they
might
have
escaped
.
in
the
end
steiner
fails
because
he
is
not
ruthless
enough
.
the
eagle
has
landed
â
has
all
the
critical
elements
of
a
tragedy
.
thats
a
big
part
of
its
success
.
is
the
eagle
has
landed
true
the
eagle
has
landed
opens
with
this
authors
note
at
precisely
one
oclock
on
the
morning
of
saturday
6
november
1943
heinrich
himmler
reichsfuhrer
of
the
ss
and
chief
of
state
police
received
a
simple
message.â
the
eagle
has
landed
.
â
it
meant
that
a
small
force
of
german
paratroops
were
at
that
moment
safely
in
england
and
poised
to
snatch
the
british
prime
minister
winston
churchill
from
the
norfolk
country
house
near
the
sea
where
he
was
spending
a
quiet
weekend
.
this
book
is
an
attempt
to
recreate
the
events
surrounding
that
astonishing
exploit.â
at
least
fifty
per
cent
of
it
is
documented
historical
fact
.
the
reader
must
decide
for
himself
how
much
of
the
rest
is
a
matter
of
speculation
or
fiction
the
novel
is
framed
with
chapters
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
author
himself
where
he
makes
further
claims
about
the
meetings
hes
had
and
the
documents
hes
examined
proving
the
story
is
true
.
there
are
also
two
maps
of
studley
constable
the
norfolk
village
where
most
of
the
story
takes
place
.
because
of
the
authenticity
some
people
are
convinced
the
story
must
beâ
true
.
lets
just
be
clear
here
the
eagle
has
landed
is
not
a
true
story
.
jack
higgins
goes
to
such
lengths
to
claim
authenticity
because
people
are
more
likely
to
accept
a
fantastical
story
if
they
think
its
true
.
this
is
a
common
trait
in
spy
thrillers
an
aura
of
authenticity
helps
maintain
the
suspension
of
disbelief
.
in
fact
there
were
no
german
spies
in
england
during
world
war
two
they
were
all
picked
up
by
mi5
.
and
any
spy
operating
their
transmitter
from
their
bedroom
twice
weekly
would
be
picked
up
in
no
time
so
mrs.
greys
part
of
the
story
is
pure
fiction
.
and
would
germany
really
send
such
a
small
force
only
just
over
a
dozen
soldiers
similar
british
paratroop
operations
like
the
bruneval
raid
consisted
of
a
minimum
of
a
company
over
a
hundred
soldiers
.
the
only
partial
claims
to
truth
are
the
soviets
claimed
to
have
foiled
a
plot
to
assassinate
churchill
stalin
and
roosevelt
at
the
tehran
conference
.
the
plot
involved
german
spies
preparing
the
way
for
a
paratroop
landing
.
the
soviets
said
they
had
foiled
the
plot
by
arresting
the
spies
but
after
the
war
otto
skorzeny
who
the
soviets
said
was
behind
the
plot
claimed
it
was
all
soviet
propaganda
.
devlin
as
we
saw
earlier
was
based
on
ira
man
frank
ryan
.
ryan
was
involved
in
various
stillborn
plots
to
supply
the
ira
with
german
money
and
weapons
one
of
which
was
called
operation
sea
eagle
.
nothing
ever
came
of
the
planned
operations
and
ryan
died
in
germany
in
1944
.
churchill
didnt
have
a
double
but
he
did
have
a
vocal
impersonator
norman
shelley
who
is
thought
to
have
recorded
some
of
his
speeches
for
radio
broadcast
.
a
british
general
bernard
montgomery
did
have
a
double
.
the
eagle
has
landedâ
alternative
cover
the
swooping
eagle
is
the
emblem
of
the
fallschirmjãger
.
its
shown
here
in
a
close
up
of
of
their
badge
.
the
red
white
and
black
colour
scheme
is
also
reminiscent
of
nazi
germany
without
the
clichã
of
including
a
swastika
.
the
eagle
has
landedâ
my
verdict
fully
deserving
of
its
status
as
a
classic
covert
operations
thriller
.
a
must
read
.
the
eagle
has
landed
the
movie
the
eagle
has
landed
â
was
filmed
in
1976
directed
by
john
sturges
andâ
starring
michael
caine
as
steinerâ
donald
sutherland
as
devlinâ
robert
duvall
as
radl
andâ
jenny
agutter
asâ
molly
.
the
movie
doesnt
work
.
michael
caine
is
badly
miscast
as
steiner
.
robert
duvallâ
has
a
good
go
at
his
role
as
do
the
supporting
cast
playing
various
nazis
.
donald
sutherland
and
jenny
agutter
are
ok
athough
the
romance
sub-plot
is
cut
down
dramatically
.
sutherland
also
looks
nothing
like
the
short
dark
devlin
described
in
the
book
.
the
worst
role
is
reserved
for
larry
hagman
who
is
given
a
disastrous
comic
turn
asâ
colonel
pitts
the
incompetent
american
commander
who
gets
his
butt
kicked
by
steiner
and
his
fallschirmjãger
.
caine
himself
has
said
he
was
disappointed
with
the
movie
claiming
john
sturgesâ
was
not
really
interested
in
making
it
and
failed
to
edit
it
effectively
the
eagle
has
landed
â
was
sturges
final
film
.
heres
the
trailer
the
eagle
has
flown
the
sequel
the
eagle
has
flown
relies
on
a
retcon
to
get
the
plot
going
.
steiner
was
clearly
dead
at
the
end
of
the
eagle
has
landed
the
second
bullet
caught
him
in
the
heart
killing
him
instantly
.
but
at
the
start
of
the
eagle
has
flown
he
is
resurrected
.
apparently
he
was
very
lucky
that
the
bullets
didnt
kill
him
.
its
hard
to
get
over
such
implausibility
but
if
you
can
live
with
it
then
the
novel
is
a
solid
enough
thriller
though
nothing
like
as
good
as
the
eagle
has
landed
.
the
plot
concerns
an
attempt
sponsored
by
himmler
for
nefarious
reasons
to
rescue
steiner
who
is
being
held
in
the
tower
of
london
.
devlin
also
returns
.
jack
higgins
wrote
two
other
novels
centred
on
the
character
of
liam
devlin
touch
the
devil
and
confessional
both
set
when
devlin
is
a
much
older
man
.
devlin
also
makes
cameo
appearances
in
some
of
