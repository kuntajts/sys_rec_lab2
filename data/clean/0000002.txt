it
was
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
a
time
of
great
change
and
great
danger
.
it
was
a
time
when
injustice
was
met
by
a
lust
for
vengeance
and
rarely
was
a
distinction
made
between
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
.
against
this
tumultuous
historical
backdrop
dickens
'
great
story
of
unsurpassed
adventure
and
courage
unfolds.unjustly
imprisoned
for
18
years
in
the
bastille
dr.
alexandre
manette
is
reunited
with
his
daughter
lucie
and
safely
transported
from
france
to
england
.
it
would
seem
that
they
could
take
up
the
threads
of
their
lives
in
peace
.
as
fate
would
have
it
though
the
pair
are
summoned
to
the
old
bailey
to
testify
against
a
young
frenchman
charles
darnay
falsely
accused
of
treason
.
strangely
enough
darnay
bears
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
another
man
in
the
courtroom
the
dissolute
lawyer
's
clerk
sydney
carton
.
it
is
a
coincidence
that
saves
darnay
from
certain
doom
more
than
once
.
brilliantly
plotted
the
novel
is
rich
in
drama
romance
and
heroics
that
culminate
in
a
daring
prison
escape
in
the
shadow
of
the

this
book
is
incredible
.
i
read
it
last
year
in
eighth
grade
and
i
love
it
.
i
love
charles
dickens
'
language
and
style
.
whoever
is
reading
this
may
have
little
or
no
respect
for
my
opinions
thinking
that
i
am
to
young
to
comprehend
the
greatness
of
the
plot
and
language
and
i
admit
that
i
probably
do
not
completely
appreciate
this
classic
piece
of
literature
.
i
do
read
above
a
12th
grade
level
although
that
does
n't
count
for
a
whole
lot
.
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
into
this
book
.
in
fact
i
dreaded
reading
it
for
a
long
time
.
but
nearer
to
the
end
i
was
drawn
in
by
the
poignant
figure
of
a
jackal
sydney
carton
.
in
his
story
i
became
enthralled
with
this
book
especially
his
pitiful
life
.
after
i
read
and
cried
at
carton
's
transformation
from
an
ignoble
jackal
to
the
noblest
of
persons
i
was
able
to
look
back
over
the
parts
of
the
book
that
i
had
not
appreciated
and
realize
how
truly
awesome
they
are
.
i
learned
to
appreciate
all
of
the
characters
from
lucy
manette
to
madame
defarge
.
i
also
was
affected
by
all
of
the
symbolism
involved
with
both
the
french
revolution
and
the
nature
of
sinful
man
no
matter
what
the
time
or
place
.
my
pitiful
review
could
never
do
justice
to
this
great
book
please
do
n't
be
discouraged
by
my
inability
.

the
more
dickens
i
read
the
more
impressed
i
become
at
his
skill
as
a
writer
.
no
matter
the
form
be
it
short
long
or
a
monolith
like
some
of
his
best
works
dickens
excels
at
changing
his
style
of
characterization
and
plot
to
fit
whatever
mode
he
writes
in
.
``
a
tale
of
two
cities
''
is
one
of
his
shorter
novels
and
he
manages
to
make
the
most
of
out
of
the
allotted
space
.
the
compression
of
the
narrative
sacrifices
dickens
's
accustomed
character
development
for
plot
and
overall
effect
but
what
we
get
is
still
phenomenal
.
``
a
tale
of
two
cities
''
begins
in
1775
with
mr.
lorry
a
respectable
london
banker
meeting
lucie
manette
in
paris
where
they
recover
lucie
's
father
a
doctor
and
mentally
enfeebled
by
an
unjust
and
prolonged
imprisonment
in
the
bastille
.
this
assemblage
on
their
journey
back
to
england
meets
charles
darnay
an
immigrant
to
england
from
france
who
makes
frequent
trips
between
london
and
paris
.
upon
their
return
to
england
darnay
finds
himself
on
trial
for
spying
for
france
and
in
league
with
american
revolutionaries
.
his
attorney
stryver
and
stryver
's
obviously
intelligent
if
morally
corrupt
and
debauched
assistant
sydney
carton
manage
to
get
darnay
exonerated
of
the
charges
against
him
.
darnay
a
self-exiled
former
french
aristocrat
finds
himself
compelled
to
return
to
france
in
the
wake
of
the
french
revolution
drawing
all
those
around
him
into
a
dangerous
scene.dickens
portrays
the
french
revolution
simplistically
but
powerfully
as
a
case
of
downtrodden
peasants
exacting
a
harsh
revenge
against
an
uncaring
aristocratic
even
feudal
system
.
the
defarge
's
a
wine
merchant
and
his
wife
represent
the
interests
of
the
lower
classes
clouded
by
hatred
after
generations
of
misuse.read

times

by

paperback
the
period
from
1775
-
the
outbreak
of
the
american
revolution
-
to
1789
-
the
storming
of
the
bastille
-
is
the
turbulent
setting
of
this
uncharacteristic
dickens
novel
.
it
is
his
only
novel
that
lacks
comic
relief
is
one
of
only
two
that
are
not
set
in
nineteenth-century
england
and
is
also
unusual
in
lacking
a
primary
central
character
.
london
and
paris
are
the
real
protagonists
in
this
tale
much
as
the
cathedral
was
the
'hero
'
of
hugo
's
notre
dame
de
paris
.
dickens
was
writing
at
a
time
of
great
turmoil
in
his
personal
life
having
just
separated
from
his
wife
and
no
doubt
the
revolutionary
theme
was
in
tune
with
his
mental
state.the
result
is
a
complex
involving
plot
with
some
of
the
best
narrative
writing
to
be
found
anywhere
and
the
recreation
of
revolutionary
paris
is
very
convincing
.
the
device
of
having
two
characters
that
look
identical
may
seem
hackneyed
to
modern
readers
but
it
is
here
employed
with
greater
plausibility
than
in
twain
's
pudd'nhead
wilson
or
collins
's
the
woman
in
white.dickens
was
inspired
to
write
this
story
by
reading
carlyle
's
newly
published
history
of
the
french
revolution
.
those
events
and
their
aftermath
stood
in
relation
to
their
time
much
as
world
wars
i
and
ii
do
to
ours
that
is
fading
from
living
memory
into
history
yet
their
legacy
still
very
much
with
us
.
in
many
nineteenth-century
novels
especially
russian
and
british
works
you
get
a
sense
of
unease
among
the
aristocracy
that
the
revolution
will
spread
to
their
own
back
yard
.
in
the
case
of
russia
of
course
it
eventually
did.i
have
often
recommended
a
tale
of
two
cities
as
a
good
introduction
to
dickens
for
younger
readers.read

by
newton
ooi
on
may
11
2006format
paperback
i
was
first
introduced
to
this
book
when
i
was
14
years
old
in
my
8th
grade
english
class
.
i
found
it
utterly
overwhelming
in
its
cast
its
plotlines
its
settings
its
themes
and
most
of
all
in
the
intricate
web
the
various
relationships
create
.
i
only
understood
three
things
about
this
book
.
first
the
two
cities
are
london
and
paris
.
second
france
was
convulsing
itself
with
the
french
revolution
while
england
was
undergoing
changes
that
would
prepare
it
to
enter
the
industrial
revolution
.
third
english
in
dickens
'
time
did
not
resemble
english
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century
but
somehow
seemed
similar
to
the
english
used
in
hollywood
epic
movies
from
the
1950s
and
1960s
like
spartacus
ben-hur
the
ten
commandments
cleopatra
etc
...
years
later
i
picked
up
this
book
and
reread
it
.
i
considered
this
a
labor
not
of
love
but
of
duty
.
this
book
is
so
famous
and
used
so
often
in
english
literature
classes
that
i
felt
i
had
to
read
it
again
for
a
deeper
understanding
.
what
i
got
from
this
book
a
2nd
time
around
is
a
profoundly
subtle
yet
accurate
sociological
and
psychological
study
of
what
happens
to
a
society
and
a
community
that
is
built
on
shaky
foundations
.
specifically
france
was
an
aristocracy
where
a
tiny
minority
owned
all
the
land
.
the
rest
of
society
was
organized
into
tiers
that
varied
in
their
opportunities
of
becoming
landowners
.
because
of
this
pyramid
structure
most
of
the
people
hewed
to
the
social
order
knowing
that
yes
they
get
crapped
on
by
those
above
them
but
there
's
always
somebody
below
them
to
take
advantage
of.eventually
this
social
ponzi
scheme
comes
to
a
screeching
halt
with
the
french
revolution
.
enough
people
have
had
enough
that
they
decide
to
start
over.read
