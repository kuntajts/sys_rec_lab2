social

this
incident
is
fictional

is
based
on
a

story
related
by
voltaire
in
a
famous
pamphlet
an
account
of
the
death
of
the
chevalier
de
la
barre.25
so
riled
is
dickens
at
the
brutality
of
english
law
that
he
depicts
some
of
its
punishments

sarcasm
``
the
whipping-post
another
dear
old
institution
very
humanising

softening

behold
in

he
faults
the
law
for
not
seeking
reform
``
whatever
is

right

is
the
dictum
of
the
old
bailey.26
the
gruesome
portrayal
of
quartering
highlights
its
atrocity
.
dickens
wants
his
readers
to
be
careful
that
the
same
revolution
that
so
damaged
france
will
not
happen
in
britain
which
at
least
at
the
beginning
of
the
book27
is
shown
to
be
nearly
as
unjust
as
france
.
but
his
warning
is
addressed
not
to
the
british
lower
classes
but
to
the
aristocracy
.
he
repeatedly
uses
the
metaphor
of
sowing
and
reaping
if
the
aristocracy
continues
to
plant
the
seeds
of
a
revolution
through
behaving
unjustly
they
can
be
certain
of
harvesting
that
revolution
in
time
.
the
lower
classes
do
not
have
any
agency
in
this
metaphor
they
simply
react
to
the
behaviour
of
the
aristocracy
.
in
this
sense
it
can
be
said
that
while
dickens
sympathises
with
the
poor
he
identifies
with
the
rich
they
are
the
book
's
audience
its
``
us
''
and
not
its
``

''
.
``

have
argued
that
in

reflects
on

ellen

was
possibly
platonic

romantic

many
have
felt
that
carton
and
darnay
are
doppelgãngers
which
eric
rabkin
defines
as
a
pair
``
of
characters
that
together
represent
one
psychological
persona
in
the
narrative
''
.32
if
so
they
would
prefigure
such
works
as
robert
louis
stevenson
's
dr.
jekyll
and
mr.
hyde
.
darnay
is
worthy
and
respectable
but
dull
at
least
to
most
modern
readers
carton
disreputable
but
magnetic.citation
needed
one
can
only
suspect
whose
psychological
persona
it
is
that
carton
and
darnay
together
embody
if
they
do
but
it
is
often
thought
to
be
the
psyche
of
dickens
himself
.
dickens
might
have
been
quite
aware
that
between
them
carton
and
darnay
shared
his
own
initials.33
however
he
denied
it

asked

the

standing
in
the
center
.
many
of
dickens
's
characters
are
``
flat
''
not
``
round
''
in
the
novelist
e.
m.
forster
's
famous
terms
meaning
roughly
that
they
have
only
one
mood.34
for
example
the
marquis
is
unremittingly
wicked
and
relishes
being
so
lucie
is
perfectly
loving
and
supportive
.
as
a
corollary
dickens
often
gives
these
characters
verbal
tics
or
visual
quirks
that
he
mentions
over
and
over
such
as
the
dints
in
the
nose
of
the
marquis
.
forster
believed
that
dickens
never
truly
created
rounded
characters

of
dr.
manette
.
she
is
the
``
golden
thread
''
after
whom
book
the
second
is
named
so
called
because
she
holds
her
father
's
and
her
family
's
lives
together
and
because
of
her
blond
hair
like
her
mother
's
.
she
also
ties
nearly
every
character
in
the
book
together.35
charles

â
a
young
french
noble
of
the
evrãmonde
family

in
disgust
at
the
cruelty
of

took
on
the

``

that
stryver

this

to
a
procession
of
monks
.
these
acts
were
attributed
to
him
it
seems
by
his
mother
's
slighted
lover
.
a
synopsis
of
the
story
is
given
by

.
dickens
is
quoting
alexander
pope
's
essay
on
man
of
1733
.
ruth
glancy
has
argued
that
dickens
portrays
france
and
england
as
nearly
equivalent
at
the
beginning
of
the
novel
but
that
as
the
novel
progresses
england
comes
to
look
better
and
better
climaxing
in
miss
pross
's
pro-britain
speech
at
the
end
of
the
novel

``
in
their
purest
form
flat
characters
...
are
constructed
round
a
single
idea
or
quality
.
...
part
of
the
genius
of
dickens
is
that
he
does
use
types
and
caricatures
people
whom
we
recognise
the
instant
they
re-enter
and
yet
achieves
effects
that
are
not
mechanical
and
a
vision
of
humanity
that
is
not
shallow

those
who
dislike
dickens
have
an
excellent
case
.
he

to
be
bad

after
dr.
manette
's
letter
is
read
darnay
says
that
``
it
was
the
always-vain
endeavour
to
discharge
my
poor
mother
's
trust
that
first
brought
my
fatal
presence
near
you
.
''

.
darnay
seems
to
be
referring
to
the
time
when
his
mother
brought
him
still
a
child
to
her
meeting
with
dr.
manette
in
book
3
chapter
10
.
but
some
readers
also
feel
that
darnay
is
explaining
why
he
changed
his
name
and
travelled
to
england
in
the
first
place
to
discharge
his
family
's
debt
to
dr.
manette
without
fully
revealing
his
identity
.

the
marquis
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
``
monseigneur
the
marquis
st
.
evrãmonde
.
''
he
is
not
so
called
in
this
article
because
the
title
``
monseigneur
''
applies
to
whoever
among
a
group
is
of
the
highest
status
thus
this
title
sometimes
applies
to
the
marquis
and
other
times
does
not
.
