					<h1>Reading Lolita in Tehran</h1>
					<h2>A Memoir in Books</h2>
					<ul id="book_sections">

						<li id="book_about" class="active">
							<p>Every Thursday morning for two years in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a bold and inspired teacher named Azar Nafisi secretly gathered seven of her most committed female students to read forbidden Western classics. As Islamic morality squads staged arbitrary raids in Tehran, fundamentalists seized hold of the universities, and a blind censor stifled artistic expression, the girls in Azar Nafisi&#8217;s living room risked removing their veils and immersed themselves in the worlds of Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Vladimir Nabokov. In this extraordinary memoir, their stories become intertwined with the ones they are reading. Reading Lolita in Tehran is a remarkable exploration of resilience in the face of tyranny and a celebration of the liberating power of literature.</p>
						</li>

												<li id="book_reviews">
							<h2>Reviews</h2>
							<p>&#8220;Resonant and deeply affecting . . . an eloquent brief on the transformative powers of fictionâon the refuge from ideology that art can offer to those living under tyranny, and art&#8217;s affirmative and subversive faith in the voice of the individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>âMICHIKO KAKUTANI, <em>The New York Times</em></p>
<p>&#8220;[A] vividly braided memoir . . . Anguished and glorious.&#8221;</p>
<p>âCYNTHIA OZICK, <em>The New Republic</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Certain books by our most talented essayists . . . carry inside their covers the heat and struggle of a life&#8217;s central choice being made and the price being paid, while the writer tells us about other matters, and leaves behind a path of sadness and sparkling loss. Reading Lolita in Tehran is such a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>âMONA SIMPSON, <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em></p>
<p>&#8220;A poignant, searing tale about the secret ways Iranian women defy the regime. . . . [Nafisi] makes you want to rush back to all these books to experience the hidden aspects she&#8217;s elucidated.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Salon</em></p>
<p>&#8220;A quietly magnificent book . . . [Nafisi&#8217;s] passion is irresistible.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>LA Weekly</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Azar Nafisi&#8217;s memoir makes a good case for reading the classics of Western literature no matter where you are. . . . [Her] perspective on her students&#8217; plight, the ongoing struggle of Iranian citizens, and her country&#8217;s violent transformation into an Islamic state will provide valuable insights to anyone interested in current international events.&#8221;</p>
<p>âHEATHER HEWETT, <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em></p>
<p>&#8220;An intimate memoir of life under a repressive regime and a celebration of the vitality of literature . . . as rich and profound as the novels Nafisi teaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>The Miami Herald</em></p>
<p>&#8220;An inspiring account of an insatiable desire for intellectual freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>USA Today</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Transcends categorization as memoir, literary criticism or social history, though it is superb as all three . . . Nafisi has produced an original work on the relationship between life and literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)</p>
<p>&#8220;Nafisi&#8217;s passion for books is infectious, and her description of the effect of the revolution on its people is unforgettable.&#8221;</p>

<p>â<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> (starred review)</p>
<p>&#8220;Nafisi artfully intertwines her own coming-of-age in pre-Revolutionary Tehran with the daily frustrations of her pupils. . . . [She] relates her girls&#8217; moving stories with great sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Entertainment Weekly</em></p>
<p>&#8220;[Nafisi] reminds us why we read in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Newsday</em></p>
<p>&#8220;As timely as it is well-written . . . As the world seems to further divide itself into them and us, Nafisi reminds her readers of the folly of thinking in black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Readers will have a new appreciation for the worn Nabokov and James titles on their bookshelves after reading Nafisi&#8217;s engaging memoir.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Nafisi&#8217;s writing has painterly qualities. . . . She is able to capture a moment and describe it with ease and melancholy. . . . Reading Lolita in Tehran is much more than a literary memoir; it becomes a tool for teaching us how to construe literature in a new, more meaningful way.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>Library Journal</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Brilliant . . . So much is right with this book, if not with this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>â<em>The Boston Globe</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I was enthralled and moved by Azar Nafisi&#8217;s account of how she defied, and helped others to defy, radical Islam&#8217;s war against women. Her memoir contains important and properly complex reflections about the ravages of theocracy, about thoughtfulness, and about the ordeals of freedomâas well as a stirring account of the pleasures and deepening of consciousness that result from an encounter with great literature and with an inspired teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>âSUSAN SONTAG</p>
<p>&#8220;A memoir about teaching Western literature in revolutionary Iran, with profound and fascinating insights into both. A masterpiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>âBERNARD LEWIS, author of <em>What Went Wrong?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who has ever belonged to a book group must read this book. Azar Nafisi takes us into the vivid lives of eight women who must meet in secret to explore the forbidden fiction of the west. It is at once a celebration of the power of the novel and a cry of outrage at the reality in which these women are trapped. The ayatollahs don&#8217;t know it, but Nafisi is one of the heroes of the Islamic Republic.&#8221;</p>
<p>âGERALDINE BROOKS, author of <em>Nine Parts of Desire</em> and <em>Year of Wonders</em></p>
<p>&#8220;When I first saw Azar Nafisi teach, she was standing in a university classroom in Tehran, holding a bunch of red fake poppies in one hand and a bouquet of daffodils in the other, and asking, what is kitsch? Now, mesmerizingly, she reveals the shimmering worlds she created in those classrooms, inside a revolution that was an apogee of kitsch and cruelty. Here, people think for themselves because James and Fitzgerald and Nabokov sing out against authoritarianism and repression. You will be taken inside a culture, and on a journey, that you will never forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>âJACKI LYDEN, author of <em>Daughter of the Queen of Sheba</em></p>

							<h2>Excerpt</h2>
							<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>
<p>In the fall of 1995, after resigning from my last academic post, I decided to indulge myself and fulfill a dream. I chose seven of my best and most committed students and invited them to come to my home every Thursday morning to discuss literature. They were all women-to teach a mixed class in the privacy of my home was too risky, even if we were discussing harmless works of fiction. One persistent male student, although barred from our class, insisted on his rights. So he, Nima, read the assigned material, and on special days he would come to my house to talk about the books we were reading.</p>
<p>I often teasingly reminded my students of Muriel Spark&#8217;s The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and asked, Which one of you will finally betray me? For I am a pessimist by nature and I was sure at least one would turn against me. Nassrin once responded mischievously, You yourself told us that in the final analysis we are our own betrayers, playing Judas to our own Christ. Manna pointed out that I was no Miss Brodie, and they, well, they were what they were. She reminded me of a warning I was fond of repeating: do not, under any circumstances, belittle a work of fiction by trying to turn it into a carbon copy of real life; what we search for in fiction is not so much reality but the epiphany of truth. Yet I suppose that if I were to go against my own recommendation and choose a work of fiction that would most resonate with our lives in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it would not be The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie or even 1984 but perhaps Nabokov&#8217;s Invitation to a Beheading or better yet, Lolita.</p>
<p>A couple of years after we had begun our Thursday-morning seminars, on the last night I was in Tehran, a few friends and students came to say good-bye and to help me pack. When we had deprived the house of all its items, when the objects had vanished and the colors had faded into eight gray suitcases, like errant genies evaporating into their bottles, my students and I stood against the bare white wall of the dining room and took two photographs.</p>
<p>I have the two photographs in front of me now. In the first there are seven women, standing against a white wall. They are, according to the law of the land, dressed in black robes and head scarves, covered except for the oval of their faces and their hands. In the second photograph the same group, in the same position, stands against the same wall. Only they have taken off their coverings. Splashes of color separate one from the next. Each has become distinct through the color and style of her clothes, the color and the length of her hair; not even the two who are still wearing their head scarves look the same.</p>
<p>The one to the far right in the second photograph is our poet, Manna, in a white T-shirt and jeans. She made poetry out of things most people cast aside. The photograph does not reflect the peculiar opacity of Manna&#8217;s dark eyes, a testament to her withdrawn and private nature.</p>
<p>Next to Manna is Mahshid, whose long black scarf clashes with her delicate features and retreating smile. Mahshid was good at many things, but she had a certain daintiness about her and we took to calling her &#8220;my lady.&#8221; Nassrin used to say that more than defining Mahshid, we had managed to add another dimension to the word lady. Mahshid is very sensitive. She&#8217;s like porcelain, Yassi once told me, easy to crack. That&#8217;s why she appears fragile to those who don&#8217;t know her too well; but woe to whoever offends her. As for me, Yassi continued good-naturedly, I&#8217;m like good old plastic; I won&#8217;t crack no matter what you do with me.</p>
<p>Yassi was the youngest in our group. She is the one in yellow, bending forward and bursting with laughter. We used to teasingly call her our comedian. Yassi was shy by nature, but certain things excited her and made her lose her inhibitions. She had a tone of voice that gently mocked and questioned not just others but herself as well.</p>
<p>I am the one in brown, standing next to Yassi, with one arm around her shoulders. Directly behind me stands Azin, my tallest student, with her long blond hair and a pink T-shirt. She is laughing like the rest of us. Azin&#8217;s smiles never looked like smiles; they appeared more like preludes to an irrepressible and nervous hilarity. She beamed in that peculiar fashion even when she was describing her latest trouble with her husband. Always outrageous and outspoken, Azin relished the shock value of her actions and comments, and often clashed with Mahshid and Manna. We nicknamed her the wild one.</p>
<p>On my other side is Mitra, who was perhaps the calmest among us. Like the pastel colors of her paintings, she seemed to recede and fade into a paler register. Her beauty was saved from predictability by a pair of miraculous dimples, which she could and did use to manipulate many an unsuspecting victim into bending to her will.</p>
<p>Sanaz, who, pressured by family and society, vacillated between her desire for independence and her need for approval, is holding on to Mitra&#8217;s arm. We are all laughing. And Nima, Manna&#8217;s husband and my one true literary critic-if only he had had the perseverance to finish the brilliant essays he started to write-is our invisible partner, the photographer.</p>
<p>There was one more: Nassrin. She is not in the photographs-she didn&#8217;t make it to the end. Yet my tale would be incomplete without those who could not or did not remain with us. Their absences persist, like an acute pain that seems to have no physical source. This is Tehran for me: its absences were more real than its presences.</p>
<p>When I see Nassrin in my mind&#8217;s eye, she&#8217;s slightly out of focus, blurred, somehow distant. I&#8217;ve combed through the photographs my students took with me over the years and Nassrin is in many of them, but always hidden behind something-a person, a tree. In one, I am standing with eight of my students in the small garden facing our faculty building, the scene of so many farewell photographs over the years. In the background stands a sheltering willow tree. We are laughing, and in one corner, from behind the tallest student, Nassrin peers out, like an imp intruding roguishly on a scene it was not invited to. In another I can barely make out her face in the small V space behind two other girls&#8217; shoulders. In this one she looks absentminded; she is frowning, as if unaware that she is being photographed.</p>
<p>How can I describe Nassrin? I once called her the Cheshire cat, appearing and disappearing at unexpected turns in my academic life. The truth is I can&#8217;t describe her: she was her own definition. One can only say that Nassrin was Nassrin.</p>
<p>For nearly two years, almost every Thursday morning, rain or shine, they came to my house, and almost every time, I could not get over the shock of seeing them shed their mandatory veils and robes and burst into color. When my students came into that room, they took off more than their scarves and robes. Gradually, each one gained an outline and a shape, becoming her own inimitable self. Our world in that living room with its window framing my beloved Elburz Mountains became our sanctuary, our self-contained universe, mocking the reality of black-scarved, timid faces in the city that sprawled below.</p>
<p>The theme of the class was the relation between fiction and reality. We read Persian classical literature, such as the tales of our own lady of fiction, Scheherazade, from A Thousand and One Nights, along with Western classics-Pride and Prejudice, Madame Bovary, Daisy Miller, The Dean&#8217;s December and, yes, Lolita. As I write the title of each book, memories whirl in with the wind to disturb the quiet of this fall day in another room in another country.</p>
<p>Here and now in that other world that cropped up so many times in our discussions, I sit and reimagine myself and my students, my girls as I came to call them, reading Lolita in a deceptively sunny room in Tehran. But to steal the words from Humbert, the poet/criminal of Lolita, I need you, the reader, to imagine us, for we won&#8217;t really exist if you don&#8217;t. Against the tyranny of time and politics, imagine us the way we sometimes didn&#8217;t dare to imagine ourselves: in our most private and secret moments, in the most extraordinarily ordinary instances of life, listening to music, falling in love, walking down the shady streets or reading Lolita in Tehran. And then imagine us again with all this confiscated, driven underground, taken away from us.</p>
<p>If I write about Nabokov today, it is to celebrate our reading of Nabokov in Tehran, against all odds. Of all his novels I choose the one I taught last, and the one that is connected to so many memories. It is of Lolita that I want to write, but right now there is no way I can write about that novel without also writing about Tehran. This, then, is the story of Lolita in Tehran, how Lolita gave a different color to Tehran and how Tehran helped redefine Nabokov&#8217;s novel, turning it into this Lolita, our Lolita.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And so it happened that one Thursday in early September we gathered in my living room for our first meeting. Here they come, one more time. First I hear the bell, a pause, and the closing of the street door. Then I hear footsteps coming up the winding staircase and past my mother&#8217;s apartment. As I move towards the front door, I register a piece of sky through the side window. Each girl, as soon as she reaches the door, takes off her robe and scarf, sometimes shaking her head from side to side. She pauses before entering the room. Only there is no room, just the teasing void of memory.</p>
<p>More than any other place in our home, the living room was symbolic of my nomadic and borrowed life. Vagrant pieces of furniture from different times and places were thrown together, partly out of financial necessity, and partly because of my eclectic taste. Oddly, these incongruous ingredients created a symmetry that the other, more deliberately furnished rooms in the apartment lacked.</p>
<p>My mother would go crazy each time she saw the paintings leaning against the wall and the vases of flowers on the floor and the curtainless windows, which I refused to dress until I was finally reminded that this was an Islamic country and windows needed to be dressed. I don&#8217;t know if you really belong to me, she would lament. Didn&#8217;t I raise you to be orderly and organized? Her tone was serious, but she had repeated the same complaint for so many years that by now it was an almost tender ritual. Azi-that was my nickname-Azi, she would say, you are a grown-up lady now; act like one. Yet there was something in her tone that kept me young and fragile and obstinate, and still, when in memory I hear her voice, I know I never lived up to her expectations. I never did become the lady she tried to will me into being.</p>
<p>That room, which I never paid much attention to at that time, has gained a different status in my mind&#8217;s eye now that it has become the precious object of memory. It was a spacious room, sparsely furnished and decorated. At one corner was the fireplace, a fanciful creation of my husband, Bijan. There was a love seat against one wall, over which I had thrown a lace cover, my mother&#8217;s gift from long ago. A pale peach couch faced the window, accompanied by two matching chairs and a big square glass-topped iron table.</p>
<p>My place was always in the chair with its back to the window, which opened onto a wide cul-de-sac called Azar. Opposite the window was the former American Hospital, once small and exclusive, now a noisy, overcrowded medical facility for wounded and disabled veterans of the war. On &#8220;weekends&#8221;-Thursdays and Fridays in Iran-</p>
<p>the small street was crowded with hospital visitors who came as if for a picnic, with sandwiches and children. The neighbor&#8217;s front yard, his pride and joy, was the main victim of their assaults, especially in summer, when they helped themselves to his beloved roses. We could hear the sound of children shouting, crying and laughing, and, mingled in, their mothers&#8217; voices, also shouting, calling out their children&#8217;s names and threatening them with punishments. Sometimes a child or two would ring our doorbell and run away, repeating their perilous exercise at intervals.</p>
<p>From our second-story apartment-my mother occupied the first floor, and my brother&#8217;s apartment, on the third floor, was often empty, since he had left for England-we could see the upper branches of a generous tree and, in the distance, over the buildings, the Elburz Mountains. The street, the hospital and its visitors were censored out of sight. We felt their presence only through the disembodied noises emanating from below.</p>
<p>I could not see my favorite mountains from where I sat, but opposite my chair, on the far wall of the dining room, was an antique oval mirror, a gift from my father, and in its reflection, I could see the mountains capped with snow, even in summer, and watch the trees change color. That censored view intensified my impression that the noise came not from the street below but from some far-off place, a place whose persistent hum was our only link to the world we refused, for those few hours, to acknowledge.</p>
<p>That room, for all of us, became a place of transgression. What a wonderland it was! Sitting around the large coffee table covered with bouquets of flowers, we moved in and out of the novels we read. Looking back, I am amazed at how much we learned without even noticing it. We were, to borrow from Nabokov, to experience how the ordinary pebble of ordinary life could be transformed into a jewel through the magic eye of fiction.</p>
